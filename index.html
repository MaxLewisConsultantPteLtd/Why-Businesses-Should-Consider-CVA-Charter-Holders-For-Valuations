                    <p>As mergers and acquisitions (M&As) rise across the region, accurate business valuation is becoming increasingly critical. Whether companies are looking to sell, merge, or acquire new assets, understanding the true value of a business is essential for a smooth transaction. One way to ensure this is by engaging Chartered Valuer and Appraiser (CVA) charter holders. These professionals, certified through a rigorous program, bring a standardised approach to business valuation that can greatly benefit businesses seeking <a href="https://www.maxlewis.com.sg/our-services/business-valuation-services/">valuation services in Singapore</a> and beyond.</p>

                    <h2>A standardised approach to valuation</h2>
                    <p>The Chartered Valuer and Appraiser (CVA) program, launched by the Institute of Valuers and Appraisers, Singapore (IVAS), is designed to ensure that professionals across Southeast Asia adopt a consistent method for business valuations. This consistency is crucial, especially in the context of M&As, where a company’s worth must be clearly understood by both the buyer and seller.</p>
                    <p>The CVA program follows internationally recognised valuation standards, developed by the International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC). This alignment with global standards ensures that CVA charter holders provide reliable, transparent, and accurate valuations, which makes negotiations smoother and avoids potential disputes over a company’s value.</p>
                    <p>Without standardised practices, different valuation methods across countries can lead to discrepancies, making it harder for parties involved to agree on a company’s worth. CVA charter holders, by adhering to the same global standards, help reduce these issues, leading to faster and more efficient transactions.</p>
                    <h2>Expertise in intangible assets</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://www.maxlewis.com.sg/the-importance-of-intangible-assets-valuation-in-singapore/">Assessing intangible assets</a>—such as intellectual property, brand recognition, and customer relationships—is one of the most complex challenges in business valuation. These elements lack clear, tangible value yet significantly impact a company’s worth. CVA charter holders are trained to navigate these complexities, ensuring accurate valuations as businesses expand across markets. New guidelines being developed will further assist valuers in evaluating intangible assets, which were valued at $61.9 trillion globally in 2023. The Institute of Valuers and Appraisers, Singapore (IVAS), is collaborating with international valuation bodies to ensure consistency and accuracy in reflecting these assets in business valuations.</p>
                    <h2>Recognition across Southeast Asia</h2>
                    <p>While the CVA program is relatively new compared to more established certifications like the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), it is rapidly gaining recognition across the region. Since its launch in 2016, the CVA program has produced nearly 300 charter holders and over 300 associate CVAs from 12 markets in the Asia-Pacific region, with the majority based in Singapore.</p>
                    <p>However, IVAS is now looking to expand the CVA program’s footprint further into Southeast Asia, with the goal of having 1,000 CVA charter holders by 2027. As the program gains more acceptance, it will become a trusted mark of quality for businesses in the region, ensuring that valuation professionals are consistently held to high standards.</p>
                    <p>By choosing a CVA charter holder for business valuation, companies are tapping into a growing network of professionals who are recognised for their expertise not just in Singapore but across key markets in Southeast Asia. This cross-border recognition can be particularly valuable for businesses involved in international transactions.</p>

                    <h2>The growing importance of consistency in business valuations</h2>
                    <p>As more cross-border deals take place, the need for a consistent valuation approach has become more evident. Different countries often follow their own sets of rules and practices when it comes to valuing businesses, which can create confusion and hinder transactions. For instance, some valuation professionals may rely on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), while others use different techniques for financial reporting.</p>
                    <p>CVA charter holders, by adhering to a uniform set of standards, help bridge these gaps. This consistency ensures that both buyers and sellers are working with the same information, narrowing the range for negotiation and allowing both sides to have reasonable expectations about the value of the business.</p>
                    <p>This not only streamlines the transaction process but also builds trust between parties. A valuation conducted by a CVA charter holder is more likely to be accepted as reliable, reducing the back-and-forth that often occurs when different valuation methods are used.</p>
                    <h2>Why businesses should choose CVA charter holders</h2>
                    <p>Given the increasing complexity of businesses today, having a professional with specialised training in valuation is more important than ever. Many businesses offer a range of services, operate in multiple countries, or own various types of assets—both tangible and intangible—that must all be considered during a valuation.</p>
                    <p>CVA charter holders bring a deep understanding of business valuation fundamentals and have the tools to accurately assess all aspects of a company’s worth. Their knowledge extends beyond general financial principles, diving into the specific techniques needed to value companies in today’s dynamic market environment.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, CVA charter holders undergo continuous education, ensuring that they stay up to date with the latest valuation standards and best practices. This dedication to professional development means that businesses can trust CVA charter holders to provide accurate, reliable valuations based on the most current information.</p>
                    <h2>The future of business valuation in Southeast Asia</h2>
                    <p>IVAS is committed to promoting the CVA certification across Southeast Asia, working with regulators and educational institutions to ensure that the program is widely accepted. As more countries begin to recognise the value of CVA charter holders, businesses will have easier access to qualified professionals who can provide high-quality valuations.</p>
                    <p>This growing acceptance of the CVA program is expected to bring more consistency to the region’s business valuation practices, making it easier for companies to conduct cross-border transactions. By choosing a CVA charter holder for their business valuation needs, companies can ensure they are working with a professional who meets the highest standards and understands the nuances of today’s complex market.</p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Using a CVA charter holder for business valuation is a smart move for companies looking to engage in mergers, acquisitions, or any other major financial transaction. These professionals bring a unique combination of expertise, consistency, and credibility, helping businesses navigate the complexities of modern valuation with confidence.</p>
